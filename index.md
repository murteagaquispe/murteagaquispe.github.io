# About
  I earned a PhD in Political Science from Harvard University in 2025. Starting this fall, I will be a postdoctoral fellow at the Kellogg Institute for International Studies at the University of Notre Dame. My research examines the political economy of development strategies with a focus on agricultural policies in Latin America. I also study rural mobilization and state building.
